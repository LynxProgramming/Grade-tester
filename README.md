# Grade Tester
This program allows you to print a specific subject's grade point average by inserting the marks you got in the tests. Also , you can choose to calculate the average grade you wish to obtain : if your current average is lower than the chosen one , then the program will display the grade you need in order to reach it. Otherwise it will display the mark you shouldn't get in order to stay above the chosen average. However , the program can display one number only  (which could be higher than 10) or can display two number , and one is not highter than 10 but the second number could be highter than 10 .
